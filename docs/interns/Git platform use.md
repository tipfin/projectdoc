# Configuration of GitHub and GitLab platforms (for Interns and Mentors)

## Create user account in GitHub 
All interns and mentors should sign up into GitHub with an email id and username, after which the admin can add them into the organisation and allot them to projects.

## Download and install GUI tool on local dektop
Users may download and install GitHub Desktop GUI tool for Windows or a GUI tool for Linux from https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis 
* https://www.collab.net/downloads/giteye#show-Linux 
* https://gitextensions.github.io/ 
* https://github.com/gitahead/gitahead/releases 

## Create user account in GitLab 
Note: This step is required only if specific CI/CD capabilities of GitLab are proposed to be used. Not required for general projects.
Sign up for GitLab at https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up?test=capabilities 
Create account using OAuth to GitHub credentials.

## Use GitHub Desktop tool for code management 
Login into GitHub and clone the selected repository to local desktop using the GitHub Desktop tool.
Use Atom, Visual Studio Code, Notepad++ or any other IDE for code development.
Store the developed code in the local repository in appropriate sub directories:

* dev/code developed code
* dev/docs developer documentation
* projectdocs project documentation (user requirements, design documents, project reports etc)
* release/v1.0/bin executables
* release/v1.0/docs installation, user and administration manuals
* release/v1.0/env documents related to the environment prior to installation setup and runtime.
Commit the modified code with comments and description

In case code from other GitHub projects is being reused, the same should be copied into the local repository in appropriate sub directories.

Markdown editors like Typora, Pandoc and GhostWriter can be used for creating and editing .md documentation files. Public files can further be published to GitHub Pages, ReadtheDocs or Documize platforms.
